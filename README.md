## Introduction

AFFP (Automated Forest Fire Prediction) is a Python-based project that uses machine learning and Tensorflow to predict and prevent forest fires. By analyzing a dataset of historical forest fire data, AFFP is able to identify patterns and trends that can help forecast the likelihood of future fires in a given area. This information can be used to take proactive measures to prevent fires from starting or spreading, and to help emergency responders better allocate their resources.

This project is part of the [AIoT Engineering & Entrepreneurial Skills Education for Gifted Students programme](https://cityueegef.github.io/about/).
